Social Data Science & Statistics
--------------------------------

This site is meant to provide a way of organizing resources for individuals
interested in socially engaged data science. A list of contributors to this site
can be found [here](contributors.html).

We are actively seeking coordination with research groups internationally, to
ensure that a diversity of voices is included in this effort!

For now, please see this copy of an
[outline](https://workflowy.com/shared/9efc1554-b705-1e27-05bd-a0078681945e/) of
an initial conversation some of us had, and
this list of [relevant links](links.html).

Lastly, there is a 
[forum on Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ds4-social-good) 
on this set of topics. Please feel free to introduce yourself there!
